\subsubsection{Choosing the Text}\label{choosing-the-text}

The two texts I have chosen to compare are Moby Dick by Herman Melville
and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne. On the surface, both of
the texts have many similarities, primarily the setting being at sea and
a climactic fight with a giant sea animal, but I am most interested in
the differences in words between the American Melville and the
translated words from the French Verne. Specifically, I am primarily
interested in seeing if the translation of the French 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea has any of the American-isms or descriptive language that
Moby Dick contains, or if the text contains more straightforward
story-telling. The Moby Dick corpus was collected from the Gutenberg
Project text already loaded into the nltk package, and 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea was collected from the project Gutenberg Project as a text
file.

\end{Verbatim}


    \subsubsection{Processing the Text}\label{processing-the-text}

The key to processing the text in this analysis is to tokenize the
various test. 20,000 Leagues has already been read into the python
environment as a string from the text file, and Moby Dick was loaded
into the python environment through the nltk package. To make the texts
usable, the contents need to be separated into tokens. The
nltk.word\_tokenize function will be used to separate the puctuation and
the various words.

One issue I had found during this step was that there were a lot of
words that did not seem appropriate in the 20,000 leagues tokens. It
turned out that the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea file downloaded from
the Project Gutenberg website contained a long list of credits and text
unrelated to the actual novel, referring to how the text was a part of
the Gutenberg Project and in the public domain. Because of this, weird
bigrams began showing up that did not make sense in the context.
Therefore, in the .txt file I had download, I deleted everything above
the note "***\emph{Book begins here}\textbf{*" and everything after the
note "***\emph{Book ends here}}*". 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was
found to have 123677 tokens and Moby Dick was fount to have 254989
tokens.

    \subsubsection{Alphabetical and Stopword
Filter}\label{alphabetical-and-stopword-filter}

While an alphabetical and stopword filter will not be used to remove
words before the bigram analysis, a stopword and non-alphabetical filter
will be used to remove words from the word frequency analysis; and after
the bigrams are processed, this filter will remove bigrams that contain
punctuation or stopwords. Additionally, french stopwords were included
in this filter because of the presence of some french articles in 20,000
Leagues under the sea (la, le, les, etc.).

    \section{Moby Dick Corpus Statistics}\label{moby-dick-corpus-statistics}

    \subsubsection{Word Frequency}\label{word-frequency}

First, a word frequency analysis was conducted on the Moby Dick tokens.
The alphabetical and stopword filter was applied to the tokens in the
Moby Dick tokens list, but was applied only within the FreqDist function
to ensure the stopwords and punctuation remained for the bigram
analysis. With these tokens removed from the Moby Dick token list, a
Frequency Dictionary was created.

Next, the most\_common method was used on the dictionary to find the 50
most used words not removed from the filter. Then, with each of the
words and counts in the most common 50 words, the word was printed,
along with the word count number divided by the length of the entire
Moby Dick token list. This normalized the word counts to be between 0
and 1, with the frequency shown being the fraction of how many times the
token appears, compared to all other tokens.

The words that appeared on the word frequency list were typically either
related to the sea, masculine, or a fairly general noun, verb, or
adjective. "Whale" was the most frequently occurring word, followed by
"one" and "like". There also appears to be a prevalence of stereotypical
old english words in the word frequency list, including "upon", "ye",
"yet", and "thou".

    \subsubsection{Bigram Frequency}\label{bigram-frequency}

The Moby Dick corpus then had its bigrams analyzed for both frequency
and PMI. First, the bigram association measures were saved in a variable
called bigram\_measures and a finder was created to find all bigrams in
the list of Moby Dick tokens. The non-alphabetical and puctiation filter
was applied to the finder, and then the bigram frequency was scored.
Finally, the bigram along with the frequency of the top 50 bigrams were
printed out.

The contents of the bigrams include have a general theme of being
related to the ocean, and specifically whales. The top four bigrams were
("sperm", "whale"), ("white", "whale"), and ("moby", "dick"). It was
also noticable there were a few instances where people were crying out
({[}"cried", "ahab"{]}, {[}"cried", "stubb"{]}, {[}"cried",
"starbuck"{]}). This suggests that maybe there were some struggle on the
ship. This is further supported by the bigram ("poor", "queequeg"),
which is the name of a character in the novel.

    \subsubsection{Bigram PMI}\label{bigram-pmi}

The bigrams in the Moby Dick corpus were also evaluated on the metric of
PMI. PMI takes the log base 2 of how much more likely the bigram is to
occur than an occurance by random chance of those two tokens occurring
together. A minimum occurance filter of 5 was also applied to the finder
make sure that the bigram occurs at least five times in order to be
considered. This would be in addition to the stopwords and
non-alphavetic filter applied in the frequency analysis.

The bigrams that appear in in order if PMI scoring are much more likely
to be proper nouns. This is somewhat intuitive as the words used in a
name or place are used less frequently than words in normal phrases or
bigrams. It is also interesting that a lot of the bigrams from the Moby
Dick corpus are related to time or number.

    \subsubsection{Trigrams}\label{trigrams}

An analysis of the trigrams in Moby Dick was also conducted. Similar to
the bigrams, the potential trigrams were narrowed down to have a minimum
frequency of 3, and to not contain any stopwords or puntuation. The
minimum frequency was applied to the trigrams before the word filter
because the minimum frequency narrows dow the potential trigrams
significantly and allows the trigrams to be processed quicker. There
were only 22 different trigrams that met these standards

The trigrams that appeared most frequently generally already had a
frequently occurring bigram. In fact, there were three different
trigrams that contained the most frequently occurring bigram, sperm
whale. Aside from the trigrams that contained "sperm whale", the only
other repeated pattern in the trigrams is the decription if a time
period "X" years ago.

Statistics}\label{leagues-under-the-sea-corpus-statistics}

    \subsubsection{Word Frequency}\label{word-frequency}

The most frequent words and bigrams in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea were
found using the same techniques and methods used to find the most
frequent words and bigrams in Moby Dick.

The most common words that remained after the removal of stopwords and
non-alphabetic tokens were largely related to the ocean or the
characters. Once again the sea-faring vessel (nautilis) appeared as one
of the most frequently occurring tokens along with the captain of the
ship, nemo. The frequently occurring words appear to be more gender
neutral.

    \subsubsection{Bigram Frequency}\label{bigram-frequency}

The frequency analysis of the bigrams in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
underwent the same processing that the Moby Dick bigrams went through.
The frequently occurring bigrams in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea were
primarily either proper nouns, or common phrases. The only maritime
related phrase in the frequent bigram list is ("submarine", "boat").

    \subsubsection{Bigram PMI}\label{bigram-pmi}

When looking at the top PMI scored bigrams, many of the bigrams are
either geographic location or descriptions or some sort of general
phrase. There are not any maritime related bigrams, aside from some
famous maritime landmarks; and there are very few names of people in the
list. If there were to be some sort of theme in the bigrams with the
highest PMI score, it would be famous landmarks, and natural/science
related phrases.

    \subsubsection{Trigrams}\label{trigrams}

The trigrams in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea tokens were also processed
to find any frequently occurring trigrams. These trigrams were filtered
to ensure that they occurred a minimum of three time, and did not
include any non-alphabetic tokens or stopwords. There were 35 different
trigrams that met these requirements.

The most prominent tokens within the trigrams are "captain" and "nemo".
More than half of the frequently occurring trigrams contained the name
Captain Nemo. There were also a prominent amount of action verbs
connected with a name, particularly verbs related to dialogue. It is
also noteworthy that four different trigrams occur frequently enough
within the text that they appear more frequently than some of the most
frequently occurring bigrams in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

    \section{Similarities}\label{similarities}

There are definitely some similarities between Moby Dick and 20,00
Leagues Under the Sea. 44\% of the top 50 most frequently occurring
tokens were shared between the two texts. These shared most frequently
occurring words words were: 'captain', 'one', 'said', 'could', 'sea',
'us', 'would', 'two', 'like', 'long', 'see', 'must', 'time', 'well',
'seemed', 'great', 'man', 'still', 'upon', 'last', 'first', and 'boat'.

Captain, boat, and sea show the similarity of the setting between the
two novels. The other shared frequently occurring words do not tell much
about the texts as they are fairly generic nouns, adjectives, and verbs.
Both novels also had the captain of the ship's name included in the most
frequent words (Ahab, and Nemo). Both novels also had the highly scored
bigram of Cape and Horn in terms of PMI. There is also very little
difference in the complexity of the two novels, as unique words make up
approximately 0.073 in both novels.

Additionally, when looking at bigrams scored by frequency and PMI, both
texts generally had characters scored high in both scoring methods.
Other than characters, simpler, more common words were generally scored
high in terms of frequency. This is likely because in addition to
intentional word pairings, there is a higher probability that these
tokens will randomly appear next to each other accidentally. Dialogue
phrases were especially abundant in the bigram list scored by frequency.

Both texts also had similarities in the bigrams that were highly scored
by PMI. These bigrams tended to be either people, places, or lengthier
words. There also fewer dialogue phrases in both of the bigrams list,
which is likely due to the higher frequency/probability of the prior
when computing the PMI.

    \section{Differences}\label{differences}

While there are some similarities, the differences between the two
novels outweigh the similarities. Firstly, the American-isms are present
in Moby Dick, and absent from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. This is seen
by the the requently occurring words in Moby Dick, which include "ye",
"thou", and "n't", while the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea tokens are
simple words that one could expect to in simplistic writings including
"land", "feet", and "large". This difference is also exacerbated by the
presence of different contractions in the frequently occurring Moby Dick
bigram list (4), and the complete absence of them in the 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea. This could be because the translator wanted to transcribe
a more formal translation of the book.

One noticable differences between the two texts can be seen in the
bigrams. The most frequently occurring bigrams in Moby Dick were related
to the plot or some sort of decriptive phrase. Sperm whale was the most
frequently occurring bigram becuse the fictional whale and main
character in the story was a sperm whale. In fact, of the 50 most
commonly occurring bigrams in Moby Dick, eight different bigrams were
whale related. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea's top 5 bigrams were related
to either a person's name or a boat in the novel. The most frequently
appearing bigrams in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea were generally either
names, verb phrases, measurements, or locations.

The differences in the frequently appearing bigrams show that there has
been a more focused effort to be descriptive of the characters and
surrounding in Moby Dick, while the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
translation was more focused on dialogue and the storytelling. This
difference is especially noticable when comparing the dialogue phrases
used in each of the novels. When a character is speaking in Moby Dick,
they tend to be crying, or in some form anguish (cried ahab, cried
stubb, cried starbuck). In 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, verb phrasing
in the dialogue is more neutral (said conseil, said captain, replied
conseil).

The trigrams analysis further support the idea that the 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea translation was more related to the actions and
interaction of characters than Moby Dick. 25 of the 35 trigrams 20,000
Leagues were contained part of a characters name and a verb. This would
suggest a more simplified story being told in 20,000 Leagues Under the
Sea, primarily of dialogue and actions of characters. The trigrams
present Moby Dick are largely whaling related or random general phrases.
Additionally, the trigrams in 20,000 Leagues Under the sea occur more
often than the trigrams in Moby Dick, as the top eight trigrams in
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea appeared more often than the top trigram in
Moby Dick.

These large difference in style are ones that I think could be
attributed to the translation of the book. Moby dick was written in
Melville's native English, in which he knows how he wants the book to
sound in English. I would imagine that if 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
had been written in English, it would share some of the same anguish in
the dialogue; however, this keeps the dialogue phrases simple with the
verbs replied and said. It is also interesting at how many frequently
occurring bigrams in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea have to deal with
numbers and measurements. The style of focusing on the story and the
characters in the 20,000 Leagues translation becomes even more apparent
when looking at the frequency of the bigrams. The (Captain, Nemo) bigram
appears more than four times as frequent as the most frequently
appearing bigram in Moby Dick (sperm, whale); additionally, the (Ned,
Land) bigram appears more than twice as often as most frequently
occurring Moby Dick bigram.

In terms of bigrams scored by PMI, Moby Dick's bigrams tend to be either
names, places or descriptions. 20,000 Leagues also has some bigrams of
places, but there is also a major scientific and engineering theme. This
is especially apparent with carbonic acid having the highest PMI score
while appearing a minimum of five times.
